This repository includes the Supplementary Material of the paper "Seamounts Ecological Modelling: A Comprehensive Review and Assessment of Modelling Suitability to Emergent Challenges".

Supplementary material 1 (SM1) presents the output of the systematic review of ecological models applied to seamount ecosystems. Sheet 1 presents the full description of abbreviations used in Sheet 2.

Supplementary material 2 (SM2) briefly describes the models found during the systematic review of ecological models applied to seamount ecosystems. We present a short description of 
Model categories (i.e., the broader aim of the model), followed by Types of Models (i.e., type of framework/software).
